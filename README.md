# Love Maths

[deployed here](https://james-adcott-edu.github.io/love-maths/)

Taking the walkthrough project as a design brief and coding myself from scratch

- using hand-made SVG images instead of fontawesome
- user input in either operand or the answer, to allow for questions like 5 + __ = 8
- using `input type="radio"` instead of buttons to choose the operation
- sensible defaults for questions:
    - additions/subtractions should stay under 100
    - multiplications/divisions should involve factors between 2 and 12
